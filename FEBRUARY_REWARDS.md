Rewards are based on your **leaderboard position**, which is determined by your activity across multiple dimensions of the Stacks ecosystem. The more you build, contribute, and engage, the higher you rank.

## 📊 Activity Tracking

Stacks Builder Rewards tracks your onchain and GitHub builder activity across the following key metrics:

### 1. Smart Contract Deployment 
**The activity and impact of the smart contracts you've deployed on Stacks**

- Code quality and security auditing are key
- Our target: 150+ verified smart contracts (`SP2F500B8DTRK1EANJQ054BRAB8DDKN6QCMXGNFBT`)

**Examples**: Atomic swaps, liquidity pools, cross-chain bridges, collateralized loans

### 2. Stacks Library Usage
**Use of @stacks/connect and @stacks/transactions in your repos**

- Integrate `@stacks/connect` for seamless wallet connectivity
- Implement advanced transaction post-conditions
- Demonstrate secure handling of user funds
- Show real-world usage patterns and best practices

**Examples**: DeFi dashboards, portfolio trackers, multi-sig wallet interfaces

### 3. GitHub Contributions
**GitHub contributions to public repositories**
