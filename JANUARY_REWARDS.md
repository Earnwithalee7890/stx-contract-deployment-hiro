## � How Rewards Work

Rewards are based on your **leaderboard position**, which is determined by your activity across multiple dimensions of the Stacks ecosystem. The more you build, contribute, and engage, the higher you rank.

## 📊 Activity Tracking

Stacks Builder Rewards tracks your onchain and GitHub builder activity across the following key metrics:

### 1. Smart Contract Deployment 
**The activity and impact of the smart contracts you've deployed on Stacks**

- Deploy production-ready contracts to Stacks Mainnet or Testnet
- Contract complexity and utility are evaluated
- Quality matters more than quantity - focus on well-tested, documented contracts
- Our target: 100+ verified smart contracts (`SP2F500B8DTRK1EANJQ054BRAB8DDKN6QCMXGNFBT`)

**Examples**: DeFi protocols, NFT collections, DAO governance systems, gaming contracts

### 2. Stacks Library Usage
**Use of @stacks/connect and @stacks/transactions in your repos**

- Integrate `@stacks/connect` for wallet connectivity in your applications
- Use `@stacks/transactions` for building and broadcasting transactions
- Demonstrate practical implementation in public repositories
- Show real-world usage patterns and best practices

**Examples**: Web3 dApps, wallet integrations, transaction builders, developer tools

### 3. GitHub Contributions
**GitHub contributions to public repositories**

- Regular commits to your Stacks-related projects
- Pull requests to Stacks ecosystem repositories
- Documentation improvements and code reviews
- Active development visible in your GitHub profile
